MAde with React, HTML, CSS JavaScript, react-router.

## Future
I do not intend to continue working on this project. Although i do notice the following bugs / improvements:
- Loading of future schedule don't work well
- images are not loaded
- The information should be displayed better
- Overall style should be less intrusive
